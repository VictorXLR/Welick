**Welick**

Welick is Supposed to be a browser game which take inspiration from the 
Twine Games. I originally planned for it to be scary with effects but the more 
i typed the more i dint feel like continuing.

See the Demo at

Its not fun at all. :(

Feel free to take it any direction you like
 All the Action happens in `Scenes.js`.

 Feel free to message me to add any effects which would be of help.

JS is weird.
